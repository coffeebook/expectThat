ExpectThat
=======

**ExpectThat** is a CoffeeScript library that helps you write expressive, self-documenting unit tests.
ExpectThat currently supports Pavlov.js.

The goals of ExpectThat are:

* to make the code of CoffeeScript unit tests speak for itself (no need to write the same thing in a comment or unit test name).
* to provide human readable unit test assertions.
* to leverage existing test frameworks, while at the same time adapting them to CoffeScript in new ways.

**Syntax**

With ExpectThat, you can write unit tests like this:

One object equals or does not equal another:

    expectThat -> 1.should equal 1

    expectThat -> 1.shouldnt equal 2

An object is true or false

    expectThat -> ("b"+"ar" is "bar").should be true

    expectThat -> ("foo" is "baz").shouldnt be true

    expectThat -> ("b"+"az" is "bar").should be false

    expectThat -> ("b" + "az" is "baz").shouldnt be false

    expectThat -> (null is null).should be true

    expectThat -> ("" is null).should be false

    expectThat -> (undefined is undefined).should be true

    expectThat -> ("" is undefined).should be false

A number is or is not greater than or less than another

    expectThat -> 10.1.should be greaterThan 10

    expectThat -> 9.shouldnt be greaterThan 10

    expectThat -> 10.1.should be lessThan 10.2

    expectThat -> 10.1.shouldnt be lessThan 10

A function throws an exception

    expectThat -> (-> throw "test exception").should throwException

A function throws an exception with a specific exception message

    expectThat -> (-> throw "test exception").should throwException "test exception"

Most assertions can be created using the `be` and/or `to` keywords:

    expectThat -> 1.shouldnt be equal to 2

    expectThat -> ("b"+"ar" is "bar").should be true

    expectThat -> ("b" + "az" is "baz").shouldnt be false

**Examples**

The following is an example of ExpectThat with Pavlov.js ( https://github.com/mmonteleone/pavlov ):

Pavlov:

    pavlov.specify "expectThat Specifications", ->
        describe "When testing should equal", ->
            foo = undefined
            before ->
                foo = "bar"
            after ->
                foo = "baz"
            expectThat -> foo.should equal "bar"
            expectThat -> foo.shouldnt equal "baz"
            expectThat -> (foo + "test").shouldnt equal "bartest2"
            expectThat -> foo.should be equal to "bar"
            expectThat -> foo.shouldnt be equal to "bah"

ExpectThat also supports custom matchers. Any matcher that evaluates to true/false can be used. Here's an example:

    ((expectThat) ->
        myCustomMatchers =
            atleastTwoGreaterThan: (expected) ->
                "assertionType": "atleastTwoGreaterThan"
                "expected": expected
                "expr": (actual, expected) -> actual >= expected + 2

        expectThat.util.extend pavlov.api, myCustomMatchers
    ) expectThat

**Roadmap**

* Add a number of additional assertions.
* Add support for additional test frameworks.
